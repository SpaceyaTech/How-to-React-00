## How to React 00

In this session we covered the basics of React from defining what React is, to talking about components, props, and state.

The take home assignment is to convert the vanilla Javascript into React. Scaffold the react project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) inside a TakeHomeAssignment Folder.

You app should be using the following React concepts:

- [Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/props.html)
- [State](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

N/B: You can use the React Folder as a reference to what we covered in this session.

## Running the app

After you scaffold your project, you can run the app with the following command:

```bash
cd TakeHomeAssignment
npm run dev || pnpm dev
```
